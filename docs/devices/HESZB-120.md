## Notes

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the temperature value set it to e.g. `{30: 0, 10: 1}`,
when temperature >= 30 precision will be 0, when temperature >= 10 precision will be 1. Precision will take into affect with next report of device.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`. Calibration will take into affect with next report of device.



## Exposes

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Smoke (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected smoke.
Value can be found in the published state on the `smoke` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` smoke is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Battery_low (binary)
Indicates if the battery of this device is almost empty.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery_low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Test (binary)
Indicates whether the device is being tested.
Value can be found in the published state on the `test` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` test is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Max_duration (numeric)
Duration of Siren.
Value can be found in the published state on the `max_duration` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"max_duration": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"max_duration": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `600`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Alarm (binary)
Manual Start of Siren.
Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"alarm": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `START` alarm is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
