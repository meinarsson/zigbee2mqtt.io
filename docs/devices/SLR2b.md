## Notes


### Sending payloads on dual channel receivers
As the receiver makes use of two endpoints, `water` and `heat` there are two methods of sending payloads, both equally valid. For example, the `heat` endpoint:

Topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`
```js
{
    "system_mode_heat":"heat"
}
```

Topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/heat/set`
```json
{
    "system_mode":"heat"
}
```

Notice that `heat` must be part of either the topic or the attribute. With that in mind, adjust the commands in this documentation based on your preferred style.

### How to start/edit native boost (heat endpoint)
The receiver has support for native Boost, which will allow to display the remaining time on a compatible remote.

To start one, or modify an already active one, send the following payload to the topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
   "system_mode_heat":"emergency_heating",
   "temperature_setpoint_hold_duration_heat":"30",  // Replace with desired duration in minutes. Max 360. 0 to stop
   "temperature_setpoint_hold_heat":"1",
   "occupied_heating_setpoint_heat":"18"  // Replace with desired temperature. Between 5 and 32 C
}
```
Note: For device timing reasons, the payload needs to be sent as one single command. Sending individual commands or settings attributes manually using the Frontend will not work.

Also, the native boost can be used as a method to pause the heating too. To do so, set the temperature to a low value.

### Set heating mode to ON (heat endpoint)
Send the following payload to the topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:
```js
{
   "system_mode_heat":"heat",
   "temperature_setpoint_hold_heat":"1",
   "occupied_heating_setpoint_heat":"20" // Replace with desired temperature. Between 5 and 32 C
}
```
Note: You will also notice that `temperature_setpoint_hold_duration_heat` automatically changes to `65535` which means `undefined` (indefinite).

This will also stop any native boosts that are currently active.


### Set heating mode to OFF (heat endpoint)
Send the following payload to the topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:
```js
{
   "system_mode_heat":"off",
   "temperature_setpoint_hold_heat":"0"
}
```
Note: You will also notice that `temperature_setpoint_hold_duration_heat` automatically changes to `0` which means `not set`. `occupied_heating_setpoint_heat` automatically changes to `1` degree C.

This will also stop any native boosts that are currently active.

### How to start/edit native boost (water endpoint)
The receiver has support for native Boost, which will allow to display the remaining time on a compatible remote.

To start one, or modify an already active one, send the following payload to the topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
   "system_mode_water":"emergency_heating",
   "temperature_setpoint_hold_duration_water":"30",  // Replace with desired duration in minutes. Max 360. 0 to stop
   "temperature_setpoint_hold_water":"1"
}
```
Note: For device timing reasons, the payload needs to be sent as one single command. Sending individual commands or settings attributes manually using the Frontend will not work.

### Set heating mode to ON (water endpoint)
Send the following payload to the topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:
```js
{
   "system_mode_water":"heat",
   "temperature_setpoint_hold_water":"1"
}
```
Note: You will also notice that `temperature_setpoint_hold_duration_heat` automatically changes to `65535` which means `undefined` (indefinite).

This will also stop any native boosts that are currently active.


### Set heating mode to OFF (water endpoint)
Send the following payload to the topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:
```js
{
   "system_mode_water":"off",
   "temperature_setpoint_hold_water":"0"
}
```
Note: You will also notice that `temperature_setpoint_hold_duration_heat` automatically changes to `0` which means `not set`.

This will also stop any native boosts that are currently active.

### Local and occupied temperature (water endpoint)
The water endpoint functions as what could be considered an on/off switch based on `system_mode_water`. Because of that, the device uses fixed values for temperature. `local_temperature_water` is always 21 and `occupied_heating_setpoint_water` is always 22.



## Exposes

### Climate (heat endpoint)
This climate device supports the following features: `occupied_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `system_mode`, `running_state`.
- `occupied_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint_heat": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the 째C between `5` and `32`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint_heat": ""}`.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in 째C). To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"local_temperature_heat": ""}`.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode_heat": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `auto`, `heat`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"system_mode_heat": ""}`.
- `running_state`: The current running state. Possible values are: `idle`, `heat`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"running_state_heat": ""}`.

### Temperature_setpoint_hold (binary, heat endpoint)
Prevent changes. `false` = run normally. `true` = prevent from making changes. Must be set to `false` when system_mode = off or `true` for heat.

manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
